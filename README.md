My group's final project for ELEG 312

This repository contains the final presentation of my group's ELEG 312 (Electronic Circuit Analysis II). I worked on circuit design, analysis, PCB layout, and testing. This project was a group effort by every member on the team. The PCBs were made in Pulsonix and simulations were done in SIMetrix.

Due to time constraints (finals were just a few days away from the presentation), we were allowed to use the auto-layout for the phaser PCB. I realize the PCB is very messy, but it was only intended for show during the presentation and not meant for fabrication.
